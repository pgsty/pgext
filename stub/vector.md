## Usage

###  Getting Started

Create a vector column with 3 dimensions

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));
```

Insert vectors

```sql
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

Get the nearest neighbors by L2 distance

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

Also supports inner product (`<#>`), cosine distance (`<=>`), and L1 distance (`<+>`)

Note: `<#>` returns the negative inner product since Postgres only supports `ASC` order index scans on operators


--------

### CRUD

Create a new table with a vector column

```sql
CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));
```

Or add a vector column to an existing table

```sql
ALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3);
```

Also supports [half-precision](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#half-precision-vectors), [binary](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#binary-vectors), and [sparse](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#sparse-vectors) vectors

**Insert vectors**

```sql
INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');
```

Or load vectors in bulk using `COPY` ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/loading/example.py))

```sql
COPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY);
```

**Upsert vectors**

```sql
INSERT INTO items (id, embedding) VALUES (1, '[1,2,3]'), (2, '[4,5,6]')
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET embedding = EXCLUDED.embedding;
```

**Update vectors**

```sql
UPDATE items SET embedding = '[1,2,3]' WHERE id = 1;
```

**Delete vectors**

```sql
DELETE FROM items WHERE id = 1;
```

### Querying

Get the nearest neighbors to a vector

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;
```

Supported distance functions are:

- `<->` - L2 distance
- `<#>` - (negative) inner product
- `<=>` - cosine distance
- `<+>` - L1 distance
- `<~>` - Hamming distance (binary vectors)
- `<%>` - Jaccard distance (binary vectors)

Get the nearest neighbors to a row

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1) LIMIT 5;
```

Get rows within a certain distance

```sql
SELECT * FROM items WHERE embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' < 5;
```

Note: Combine with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to use an index


#### Distances

Get the distance

```sql
SELECT embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' AS distance FROM items;
```

For inner product, multiply by -1 (since `<#>` returns the negative inner product)

```sql
SELECT (embedding <#> '[3,1,2]') * -1 AS inner_product FROM items;
```

For cosine similarity, use 1 - cosine distance

```sql
SELECT 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') AS cosine_similarity FROM items;
```

#### Aggregates

Average vectors

```sql
SELECT AVG(embedding) FROM items;
```

Average groups of vectors

```sql
SELECT category_id, AVG(embedding) FROM items GROUP BY category_id;
```

### HNSW Indexing

By default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search, which provides perfect recall.

You can add an index to use approximate nearest neighbor search, which trades some recall for speed. Unlike typical indexes, you will see different results for queries after adding an approximate index.

Supported index types are:

- [HNSW](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#hnsw)
- [IVFFlat](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#ivfflat)

An HNSW index creates a multilayer graph. It has better query performance than IVFFlat (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff), but has slower build times and uses more memory. Also, an index can be created without any data in the table since there isn’t a training step like IVFFlat.

Add an index for each distance function you want to use.

L2 distance

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

Note: Use `halfvec_l2_ops` for `halfvec` and `sparsevec_l2_ops` for `sparsevec` (and similar with the other distance functions)

**Inner product**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);
```

**Cosine distance**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

**L1 distance**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l1_ops);
```

**Hamming distance**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_hamming_ops);
```

**Jaccard distance**

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_jaccard_ops);
```

Supported types are:

- `vector` - up to 2,000 dimensions
- `halfvec` - up to 4,000 dimensions
- `bit` - up to 64,000 dimensions
- `sparsevec` - up to 1,000 non-zero elements

#### Index Options

Specify HNSW parameters

- `m` - the max number of connections per layer (16 by default)
- `ef_construction` - the size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (64 by default)

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

A higher value of `ef_construction` provides better recall at the cost of index build time / insert speed.

#### Query Options

Specify the size of the dynamic candidate list for search (40 by default)

```sql
SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;
```

A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed.

Use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search = 100;
SELECT ...
COMMIT;
```

#### Index Build Time

Indexes build significantly faster when the graph fits into `maintenance_work_mem`

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem = '8GB';
```

A notice is shown when the graph no longer fits

```
NOTICE:  hnsw graph no longer fits into maintenance_work_mem after 100000 tuples
DETAIL:  Building will take significantly more time.
HINT:  Increase maintenance_work_mem to speed up builds.
```


Note: Do not set `maintenance_work_mem` so high that it exhausts the memory on the server

Like other index types, it’s faster to create an index after loading your initial data

You can also speed up index creation by increasing the number of parallel workers (2 by default)

```sql
SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader
```

For a large number of workers, you may need to increase `max_parallel_workers` (8 by default)

The [index options](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#index-options) also have a significant impact on build time (use the defaults unless seeing low recall)

#### Indexing Progress

Check [indexing progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/progress-reporting.html#CREATE-INDEX-PROGRESS-REPORTING)

```sql
SELECT phase, round(100.0 * blocks_done / nullif(blocks_total, 0), 1) AS "%" FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;
```

The phases for HNSW are:

1. `initializing`
2. `loading tuples`
