`pg_integrity_checksums` computes physical and logical checksums for PostgreSQL pages, cells, tuples, tables, indexes and databases. This C extension supports PostgreSQL 12–19 upstream; the catalog's Pigsty packages target PostgreSQL 14–18. Installation and database-wide checks require a superuser.

### Install and migrate

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_integrity_checksums;
```

### Version 2.3.0 and page verification

Version 2.3.0 adds `pg_page_checksum_status(regclass, integer)`, which compares a page's calculated 16-bit checksum with its stored `pd_checksum`. After installing the matching library and SQL files, upgrade an existing 2.2.0 installation:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION pg_integrity_checksums UPDATE TO '2.3.0';
SHOW data_checksums;
SELECT pg_page_checksum_status('public.orders'::regclass, 0);
```

The relation must exist and contain the requested block. Results are `ok` for a match, `mismatch` for a difference, `new` for an uninitialized page, or `checksums_disabled` when stored page checksums are disabled. Stored-page verification requires `data_checksums = on`; an invalid relation or block raises an error.

`pg_page_checksum()` only calculates PostgreSQL's 16-bit page checksum; it does not compare the stored value. Its result of zero can mean an uninitialized page or a calculated zero, so zero alone does not establish validity. The status function reads relation storage directly and reports the page it reads, rather than a persistent guarantee about later writes.

The FNV-1a 32/64-bit overloads introduced in 2.2.0 still return raw `bytea` digests alongside the legacy 32-bit SQL API. They are separate from PostgreSQL's 16-bit page-checksum format. Changing the selected algorithm or overload requires a matching baseline; the 2.3.0 page-status addition does not itself require recomputing all existing baselines.

### Migration from the old extension name

Version 2.0.0 is the renamed continuation of the earlier `pg_checksums` extension. PostgreSQL has no `ALTER EXTENSION ... RENAME`; review dependent objects, drop the old extension, create the new one, and change the GUC prefix before using the new name:

```sql
DROP EXTENSION pg_checksums;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_integrity_checksums;
SET pg_integrity_checksums.workers = 4;
SET pg_integrity_checksums.strict = on;
```

The old and new names cannot coexist because they define the same SQL functions. The unrelated core `pg_checksums` utility is a separate program.

### Checksum levels

Use logical checksums for content comparison and physical checksums for storage integrity. Logical table checksums do not require a primary key, preserve duplicate rows, and exclude relation and tuple identifiers. Logical index checksums are derived from visible table rows and the index definition, so they are stable across `VACUUM`, `CLUSTER` and `REINDEX`.

```sql
SELECT pg_table_logical_checksum('public.orders'::regclass);
SELECT pg_index_logical_checksum('public.orders_pkey'::regclass);
SELECT pg_database_logical_checksum(false, true);
```

Physical checksums include storage details and can change after `VACUUM FULL`, `CLUSTER`, `REINDEX` or other physical rewrites. Use the page, tuple and table physical functions when those changes are relevant to the integrity baseline.

### Privileges and maintenance

Relation-level functions require table-level `SELECT` and reject row-level-security protected relations because direct storage scans cannot apply RLS; column-only grants are insufficient. Database-level functions are superuser-only. `pg_integrity_checksums.workers` controls parallel scans; `pg_integrity_checksums.strict` makes database scans fail when a relation cannot be checked instead of skipping it. The extension does not require shared preload. Preserve a known-good baseline for the same algorithm and compatible schema, and account for physical rewrites when comparing physical checksums. These checksums are not cryptographic authentication.
